# ðŸ¦¾ Antipodal Grasping with Point Clouds

This project implements an automated grasping pipeline in a simulated PyBullet environment. It uses point cloud data to detect objects, compute antipodal grasps, and control a robot to remove objects from the scene.

## ðŸš€ Pipeline Overview

1. **Initialize Simulation**  
   Set up the environment.

2. **Capture Scene**  
   Retrieve point cloud data from virtual cameras.

3. **Segment Objects**  
   Use DBSCAN clustering to identify individual objects.

4. **Compute Grasp Poses**  
   For each object, find a grasp point near the centroid and compute grasp orientation (`theta`) based on surface normals.

5. **Execute Grasp**  
   Move the robot to perform the grasp and drop the object into a bin.

6. **Repeat**  
   Loop until the scene is cleared.
